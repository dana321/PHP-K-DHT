PHP-K-DHT
==================

A PHP implementation of the Bittorrent DHT protocol.

There are 2 parts to this project

* A client part which focuses on Querys too a selected DHT Node e.g router.bitttorrent.com:6881
* A server part which focuses on being a DHT Node and taking requests.

Also these 2 parts will be merged together to create a platform which will be used
as an interface into the Bittorrent DHT.


Please feel free to modify the code.
